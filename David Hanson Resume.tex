\href{https://www.mka.com}{\textbf{Magnusson Klemencic Associates}} \\
\textit{Design Engineer \hfill 2019 -- 2020} \\
%% Receptive to feedback and seeks it out to grow as an engineer and team player. 
\textbf{\small{One Chicago Square -- Chicago, IL}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Two-tower building on a shared podium with a tuned-sloshing damper occupying a full city block in Chicago. Designed post-tensioned slabs as the primary design engineer for the 50-story residential tower and provided mild slab design support for the adjacent 78-story tower.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1mm}
\textbf{\small{Epic Medical Solutions \textbar{} Mystery, Campus 5 -- Verona, WI}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Designed the major gravity and lateral components of a 3-story steel office building. Architecture was under constant revisions based on evolving design vision. Navigated the changes with alacrity, collaborating to address problems and meet deadlines.
    \item  Project located on an existing parking garage that was not originally designed for future development under the unique project footprint. Developed safe, constructible solutions for strengthening the existing parking garage under new building loads. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1mm}
\textbf{\small{5\textsuperscript{th} and Brazos -- Austin, TX}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Worked as the primary point of contact for construction administration of a 32-story residential concrete building. Provided numerous post-install solutions for connections with unique geometric constraints. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1mm}
\textbf{\small{4\textsuperscript{th} and Brazos -- Austin, TX}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Performed lateral analysis studies in ETABS to determine optimal shear wall design for schematic study an 80-story concrete residential building. Produced a somewhat unconventional but highly effective solution and proposed it to the project's Principle in Charge. It was ultimately decided to use one of the more conventional solutions due to architectural considerations.

\textbf{\small{Baffinland Iron Mines Port Design}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Oversaw quality control as the single representative engineer on site for the completion of PND's Open Cell Sheet Pile\ts{\textregistered} port structure. Coordinated with construction and surveying representatives to ensure conformance to dredging and scour rock placement tolerances, among other finalizing project details. Project costs totaled \$45 million.
