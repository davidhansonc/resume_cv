\href{https://www.mka.com}{\textbf{Magnusson Klemencic Associates}} \\
\textit{Design Engineer} \\
Collaborated with a team of three to five highly skilled engineers designing high-rise 
residential and office buildings. Received extensive in-house training, particularly in 
the design of concrete systems. 

\textbf{\small{One Chicago Square}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Nearly 1000 feet tall, two-tower building on a shared podium with a tuned-sloshing 
    damper occupying a full city block in Chicago. Designed post-tensioned slabs as 
    the primary design engineer for the 50-story residential tower and provided mild slab 
    design support for the adjacent 78-story tower.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1mm}
\textbf{\small{Epic Medical Solutions \textbar{} Mystery, Campus 5}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Designed all major structural components of a 3-story steel office 
    building in Verona, Wisconsin. Architecture was under constant revisions based on 
    evolving design vision. 
    Navigated the changes with alacrity, collaborating to address problems and meet 
    deadlines.
    \item  Project located on an existing parking garage that was not originally designed 
    for future development under the unique project footprint. Developed safe, 
    constructible solutions for strengthening the existing parking garage under new 
    building loads. 
\end{itemize}

% \textbf{\small{5\textsuperscript{th} and Brazos}}
% \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
%     \item  Worked as the primary point of contact for construction administration of a 
%     32-story residential concrete building. Provided timely solutions for structural 
%     connections with unique geometric constraints. 
% \end{itemize}
% \vspace{1mm}
\textbf{\small{4\textsuperscript{th} and Brazos}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Performed lateral analysis studies to determine optimal 
    design for schematic study an 80-story concrete residential building. Produced a 
    somewhat unconventional but highly effective solution and proposed it to the 
    project's Principle in Charge. It was ultimately decided to use one of the more 
    conventional solutions due to architectural considerations.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Staff Engineer} \\
\textbf{\small{Baffinland Iron Mines Port Design}}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Oversaw quality control as the single representative engineer on site for 
    the completion of PND's Open Cell Sheet Pile\ts{\textregistered} port structure. 
    Coordinated with construction and surveying company representatives for project
    completion. Project costs totaled \$45 million.
